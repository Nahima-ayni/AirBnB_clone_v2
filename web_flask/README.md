## What is Flask?

Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It provides tools, libraries, and patterns for building web applications. Flask is known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Installation

To install Flask, you need to have Python installed on your system. Then, you can use pip, Python's package manager, to install Flask. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install flask
```

This will download and install Flask and its dependencies on your system.

## Purpose of Flask

Flask is used to simplify the process of building web applications in Python. It provides features such as URL routing, request handling, and template rendering, allowing developers to focus on building the core functionality of their applications without worrying about low-level details.

## What is a Web Framework?

A web framework is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that help developers build web applications more efficiently. It provides a structured way to handle tasks such as routing URLs, processing HTTP requests, and generating HTML responses.

## How to Build a Web Framework with Flask

Building a web application with Flask involves creating routes, defining views, and rendering templates. Flask follows a simple and modular architecture, making it easy to extend and customize.

## Defining Routes in Flask

Routes in Flask map URLs to view functions. You can define routes using Python decorators. Each route corresponds to a specific URL pattern and triggers a specific action when accessed.

## What is a Route?

A route in Flask is a URL pattern associated with a view function. When a client sends an HTTP request to a specific URL, Flask matches the URL to the corresponding route and executes the associated view function.

## Handling Variables in a Route

Flask allows you to include variable parts in route URLs. These variables can be extracted and passed as arguments to the corresponding view function, allowing for dynamic content generation based on the URL.

## What is a Template?

A template in Flask is an HTML file that contains placeholders for dynamic content. Templates are used to generate HTML responses dynamically by injecting data into the placeholders.

## Creating an HTML Response in Flask

To create an HTML response in Flask, you can use the `render_template` function to render an HTML template and pass data to it. This allows you to generate HTML content dynamically based on the data provided by your Flask application.

## Creating a Dynamic Template

Flask supports dynamic templates with loops, conditions, and other control structures using Jinja2 syntax. You can use loops to iterate over lists or dictionaries and conditions to display content based on logical expressions.

## Displaying Data from a MySQL Database in HTML

To display data from a MySQL database in HTML using Flask, you can use Flask-SQLAlchemy, an extension that integrates SQLAlchemy, a popular SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, with Flask. With Flask-SQLAlchemy, you can define database models, query data, and pass it to your templates for display.
